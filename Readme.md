## 🧠 About Me

Hi! I’m Baher — a passionate developer blending backend logic, frontend creativity, cloud automation, and immersive game design.

I specialize in:

- ⚙️ Java Spring Boot & React.js fullstack development  
- ☁️ Cloud architecture & deployment (AWS, Docker, CI/CD)  
- 🎮 Game development using Unity, Unreal Engine & Godot  

I thrive on building things that are efficient, reliable, and fun to use — from enterprise APIs to pixelated adventures.
